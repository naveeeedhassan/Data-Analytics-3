A common goal among companies in today’s data-driven world is to become smarter—to know
where the market opportunities lie, where supply chain logjams are and where process
improvements can be found. Data science has been the fuel behind this trend, and now data
science is itself becoming smarter. Thanks to astonishing advancements in artificial intelligence
(AI) and its sub-segments machine learning and deep learning, companies are achieving new
levels of efficiency in data analysis that impact their entire business. The rising tide of AI adoption across industries will drive significant growth in the next decade, with AI software
revenue set to reach almost $90 billion by 2025. AI’s presence is tantalizing to data scientists
and business managers alike who seek to let machines do the number crunching to make the
business smarter on a holistic level.

AI on the Fast Track
A leading indicator of a market segment’s growth path can usually be found by following the
money trail. Investors and venture capital (VC) firms are always looking for big growth
opportunities, and they are finding one now in the AI business. Forbes recently reported that
there has been a 14x increase in the number of active AI startups since 2000, and investment
into these startups by VC firms has increased 6x in that period. Meanwhile, companies that both
build and utilize AI applications are on a similar growth path, with jobs requiring AI skills
increasing 4.5x since 2013. If you are looking to start your AI journey, then check out our AI &
Machine Learning Bootcamp.

IT Is a Big AI Beneficiary
It should come as no surprise that the department that deals full-time with data—namely the IT
organization—is perhaps the biggest beneficiary of AI’s capabilities. A Harvard Business Review
study reports that between 34 and 44 percent of global companies they surveyed are using AI to
help resolve employee technical support issues (imagine a smart response system to streamline
common questions and troubleshoot others), automate internal system enhancements (machine
codes can be used to calculate where bottlenecks can be fixed), and ensure that employees only
use technology from approved vendors (picture a smart authorization engine that keeps up with
daily updates and knows vendor subsidiaries and partners).

But AI Is Cross-enterprise Too
Where else is AI finding a home? Among the most common examples of AI in the enterprise are
image recognition and tagging, patient data processing, localization and mapping, predictive
maintenance, predicting and thwarting security threats, and intelligent recruitment and HR
management techniques. But perhaps the most active adoption is being seen in the marketing
and sales operation, where intelligent use of data and the ability to learn from human interactions
can produce big financial benefits. In a Statista worldwide survey, 87 percent of current AI
adopters said they were using or considering using AI for sales forecasting and for improving email marketing. While sales forecasting is often automated by technology to a point, it can be
vastly improved with an AI agent that monitors and reacts to customer interactions and shifting
market patterns. Email marketers similarly can create a sense of one-to-one marketing through
more intelligent targeting and content creation for various audiences.
The bottom line is also important. McKinsey found that companies who benefit from AI
initiatives and have invested in infrastructure to support its scale achieve a three to fifteen
percentage point higher profit margin. Healthcare, financial services, and professional services
are seeing the greatest increase in their profit margins as a result of AI adoption.

Examples of Companies Taking the Lead in AI Adoption
Here are a few examples of how specific companies in various industries are leveraging AI in
their businesses:
According to the McKinsey study, tech giants including Baidu and Google spent between $20B to
$30B on AI in 2016, with 90 percent of this spent on R&D and deployment, and 10 percent on AI
acquisitions. The current rate of AI investment is 3x external investment growth since 2013.
Netflix has also achieved impressive results from the AI algorithm it uses to personalize
recommendations to its 100 million subscribers worldwide, improving search results and
avoiding canceled subscriptions from frustrated customers who couldn’t find what they wanted
(with a potential impact of $1B annually).
Financial data specialist Bloomberg uses techniques like computer vision and natural language
processing to improve the breadth of information available through their ubiquitous terminals
that financial staff use to access market information. Users can use natural language in queries
instead of specialized technical commands which is analyzed and executed by AI

Uber has a core team providing pre-packaged machine learning algorithms 'as-a-service' to its
team of mobile app developers, map experts, and autonomous driving teams. These capabilities
are used to better predict traveling habits and improve maps using computer vision, and to
create algorithms for its autonomous vehicles.
And Royal Bank of Scotland recently launched a natural language processing AI bot that will
answer its banking customer questions and perform simple banking tasks such as money
transfers, with the goal to make digital customer support as powerful as face-to-face interaction.
AI and Machine Learning are revolutionizing the way companies access and process data to
become smarter and more efficient organizations. And IT and data science teams are gearing up
for the immense benefits of AI in their enterprises.

Impact of Artificial Intelligence in 2023
The impact of artificial intelligence on modern culture are hotly contested. Others believe that AI
positively impacts people's daily lives because it can perform mundane and even complex
activities more efficiently and effectively than humans can. Yet some worry that AI will lead to
increased levels of unemployment, invasion of privacy, and racial profiling.

Can AI Replace Human Intelligence?
The eventual takeover of humanity by AIs and our eventual extinction are not an impossibility.
To assume that the current limitations of AIs in reasoning and decision-making are not

indicative of their future capabilities.
It's not out of the question that AI computers trained to respond appropriately to new
situations would one day cease to need human supervision.
Artificial intelligence has displaced human labour in today's factories and workshops. In the
packing sector, for instance, machines have mostly taken over tasks that were once
performed by hand.
Artificial intelligence has mostly supplanted human workers in telemarketing and customer
support. The constant availability and low barriers to entry of chatbots have made them
popular in these sectors.

Impact of AI
Voice-Based Search
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on nearly every area of
human existence. One AI technology that benefits from AI's ability to streamline processes for its
users is speech recognition. The latest innovation can transcribe your voicemails into text for
you. It can also teach your speech to issue commands with your voice. As a result, Apple,
Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc., have given this AI-powered speech recognition
technology a lot of attention. Devices and software with built-in voice recognition are already
commonplace; examples include Amazon's Echo, Apple's Siri, and Google's Home.
AI In Healthcare
The use of AI in healthcare has only recently begun. Machine learning (ML) offers promise in
identifying trends within a population, similar to how computer vision (CV) can diagnose
diseases using X-rays and NLP (natural language processing) can in medication safety. All of
these advancements for patients will come together once we achieve real information
interoperability, which supports the safe interchange of health data.
The Impact of AI on Jobs
Artificial intelligence (AI) will have future repercussions for your company. There is the possibility
of a significant effect on how your business functions, yet there is no apparent downside. It calls
for an optimistic outlook and an eagerness to try something new.
Many sectors of the economy are experiencing profound shifts due to the advent of AI. When

applied to commercial processes, AI's ability to recognise patterns and spot anomalies in
massive volumes of digital information ushers new avenues of opportunity. It can perform a wide
variety of everyday activities competently if trained.
Employees are freed from mundane, repetitive work so they may focus on higher-level technical
difficulties or enhance the quality of customer care made possible by the advent of AI.
Business Intelligence
Data produced by customers, tools, and procedures is overwhelming for businesses. People find
that the standard business intelligence tools they've been using still need to cut it. Artificial
intelligence-driven solutions will soon replace traditional methods like spreadsheets and
dashboards. These instruments can automatically probe the data, learn insights, and make
recommendations. These resources will transform how businesses leverage information and
make decisions.
Education
An area where AI is expected to have a significant impact on education. AI will significantly
assist the education sector and system, which needs a considerable overhaul. All that must be
done is pinpoint what needs to change and lay out a plan for implementing that change. One
factor that could prove to be a game-changer in this regard is the use of AI easy writer in creating
a unique, practical, and practically applicable learning path for any subject or topic.
Retail
Artificial intelligence will have profound effects on the retail sector. Retailers will invest heavily in
artificial intelligence (AI) to provide superior customer service in the following years. Marketers in
the retail industry are anticipated to start using AR/VR capabilities. The popularity of interactive,
aesthetically pleasing product catalogues, where the final consumer can try out an item before
buying it, is predicted to skyrocket.
