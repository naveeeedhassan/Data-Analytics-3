Thanks to the spread of the Internet, the traditional workforce has already undergonesignificant changes. Things like e-mail and telecommunications have made work moreflexible and brought people together, even if they’re geographically far apart. It has alsoenabled the rise of the gig economy.

Today, people have more flexibility in their employment models; they no longer have torely on classic work 9 to 5 to provide for themselves. Instead, they can embrace a morecreative and efficient work life, taking on short-term work at will or need. This is known asthe gig economy.

But why does the gig economy have such a great impact on the future of work, and whatopportunities does it present for both businesses and workers?

What is the gig economy?

Have you ever used an app to call a freelance taxi driver, book a vacation rental, orderfood, or buy some homemade goods? These are all examples of a gig economy. Manyroles can be classified as a part of this model, including:

Freelancers
Consultants
Independent contractors and professionals
Temps (temporary contract workers), etc.


In general, the gig economy is about exchanging labor for money between individuals orcompanies through digital platforms that directly connect suppliers and customers on ashort-term basis and are pay-as-you-go.

The gig economy has ballooned in recent years as different gig economy apps arrive totackle nearly every facet of the service industry. The changes introduced by thecoronavirus pandemic have only accelerated the gig economy’s growth, as peoplestaying home and minimizing contact opt for personal home deliveries for many of theirdaily chores and consumer necessities. According to a report by Mastercard, globaltransactions associated with the gig economy will grow by 17% per year to about $455billion by 2023.

Of course, as the gig economy expands and more companies functioning on the modelare found, the challenge for politicians and officials becomes to balance innovation thatcreates jobs, and the need to ensure that companies offer workers a fair deal. Forinstance, the U.K. government claimed that independence and flexibility are the keyaspects that people working in the gig industry are often satisfied with. The gig economyhas also gradually become an excellent source of income and job opportunities forstudents, working parents, and people who are otherwise occupied with home carework.

Examples of a gig economy

The most striking example of the gig economy is freelancing. The Internet and big datahave allowed the gig economy to exist and scale up into services people can actuallyuse. Today, connecting to the Internet is all it takes to make a deal or conduct atransaction.

Many companies like TaskRabbit, Fiverr, and Handy use the gig economy. Specifically,
they prefer to use a ratings-based marketplace with secure payment systems, usuallyformatted as a custom or bespoke app. Meanwhile, cloud platforms have made all thiseasier by making it easy to bring together independent workers, employees, andcustomers.

Some apps that can help a gig worker organize their work life are: Upwork(freelance services), Airtasker (create the to-do list).
Examples of gig economy apps: Fiverr (freelance services), TaskRabbit (homeimprovement projects), Uber (transport).


Micha Kaufman, founder, and CEO of Fiverr, once said that gig economy platforms arebecoming a personal brand and the professional identity of the worker employed bythem. Good gig economy platforms reward good work and excellent results withreliable feedback that boosts trust and encourages more business.

How does the gig economy fit into the futureof the work?

Thanks to a new wave of online platforms, gig employees taking part in short-term“digital work” or “gigs” usually receive money after each task. According to a recentManulife Investment Sentiment Index (MISI) survey, 31% of professionals do so, at leastpart-time.

Gone are the days when freelancers had to spend an incredible amount of time buildingprofessional reputations before getting their first cent. Today, this is taken care of by thedigital platforms that form the basis of the gig economy. By providing transparentcustomer assessment tools, simple dispute resolution mechanisms, and rigorousverification processes, these platforms ease user concerns and thus help reduce barriersto entry into large sectors of the economy.

The success of Uber shows the gig economy really works and fits the future of work.
Many companies view temporary contracts with freelancers with unique skills as a moreviable long-term strategy to keep up with changing market demands than constantlyretraining permanent employees.

According to The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman: “What can be done willbe done.” In this age of technological acceleration, no one can afford to rest on theirlaurels. Market needs are constantly changing due to accelerating technologicalprogress. This means that traditional career growth can be much more challenging –
especially for gig workers. Without a structured career path, their achievements on oneplatform are typically not respected by another – but it does help them keep their skillsup to date.

Tools like Skype and WhatsApp have reduced the cost of international communication.
Prestigious universities now offer thousands of free, world-class courses on websites thatanyone can access. Thousands of articles and megabytes of data are available at thetouch of a button. This means that the gig economy may soon be associated not with thecomparatively low-skill jobs of the service industry, but with highly-skilled, independentworkers.

The movement of ideas, goods, money, and people stimulates the growth of the worldeconomy. The gig economy serves as one way to lubricate that movement. As foremployers, they’ve never had so much free access to the talents needed to improve theirbusiness, nor have they had the communication tools to easily reach out to potentialworkers, customers, and partners around the world.

Pros & Cons of the gig economy fororganizations

It’s pretty challenging to determine exactly how many working adults are involved in thegig economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 1.6 million peoplebenefit from the additional income provided by gig economy work. In fact, many gigeconomy workers only use the model as a supplement to their main, or full-time, jobs.

For gig workers

The main benefits of the gig economy for workers are as follows:

Higher salaries, dependent on the performance
Flexible working schedule – pick up and earn
Location-independent opportunities
A large variety of gig platforms in different industries.


Apart from the benefits, there are also some disadvantages:

Lack of traditional employee benefits such as health insurance or paid leave
Isolation and lack of cultural identification with a company.

Employers can also benefit from the gig economy:

However, there are some pitfalls you should pay attention to:

Tight regulations on contractor status in some jurisdictions
Lower corporate loyalty from workers.


Summing up

The lack of labor capacity in skilled workers and the rise of the gig economy suggest onecore constant: that the nature of work is changing, and businesses need to be preparedto support that change.

According to Peter Miscovich, Managing Director of Strategy + Innovation at JLLConsulting in New York, the gig economy will account for half of the workforce by 2030.

Soon, most corporate entities will be based on the latest “Hollywood” model of work,
where agile and rare-knowledge workers will be in demand on a project-to-project basis.
